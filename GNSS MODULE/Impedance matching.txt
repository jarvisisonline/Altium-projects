Impedance 
it's the sum of all resistace and reactance(capacitor + inductor)
 in the circutit 
1. Voltage Trasfer
 input impedance high
 output impedace low
2. Power 
 If the impedance is equal on the both sides then maximum power tranfer
 will occur
3.High Frequency
 If the impedance doesn't match then the signal will be refelected back
